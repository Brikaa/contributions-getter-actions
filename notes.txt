Goal:
    - Have all of the public repositories I have contributed to in my GitHub README.md
    - Update the README automatically at a certain time interval
    - Only create new commits if the contributions change
    - Highlight highly-starred repos
    - Such highlight format is configurable (and there is a default format)
    - Number of stars needed for highlight is configurable (and there is a default number)
    - Configurable repo header format according to what contributions-getter returns
    - Ability to include other MarkDown content before or after
Phase 1:
    - Create the script that creates the markdown file
        - On running
            - Use contributions-getter to get the contributions (possibly with a certain configuration)
            - Config contains: contributionsGetterConfig, headerFormat, highlightFormat, fileBefore, fileAfter
            - headerFormat provides $REPO_NAME, $NO_COMMITS, $PRIMARY_LANGUAGE, $REPO_DESCRIPTION, $REPO_LINK,
            $COMMITS_LINK
            - highlightFormat provides $HEADER
